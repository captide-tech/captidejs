# captide.js

Captide enables precise querying across over 750,000 SEC filings and earnings calls, offering best-in-class accuracy for financial analysis. It streamlines data extraction, investment research, and document review—accessible through a user-friendly interface at app.captide.co or directly via API.

Our specialized AI agent is built to deliver accurate, document-grounded financial insights in response to natural language queries. The AI scans thousands of filings to surface the most relevant answers, currently supporting SEC-related content and international companies listed with the SEC. Our coverage is rapidly expanding to new regions and document types.

This npm package is designed for Captide API users who want to display source documents in their frontend applications. It helps attribute the AI agent's outputs—such as specific sentences or metrics—directly to their original sources. The package automatically renders SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and international disclosures, highlighting the relevant sections that support the AI's responses.
